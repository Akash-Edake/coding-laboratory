1. JS commnets:
	Comments are going to give hint or more info to developer.
	single line comment
	multi line comments.

2. Variables:
	It can store the data.
	It is used to excahnge the data.
	there are two type of variavbles in JS 
	Local variavbles and Global varibale.
	Local variavbles: It allows to use in some specific block of code.
	Global variavbles: It allows to use throught the program.
	In JS we can create variavbles with the help of let, var, const, or direct variabel name.
	
	Set of Rules to create JS variavbles:
	1. Keywords can not be used as variavbles.
	2. can not start with number.
	3. can start with '_';
	4. Variables are case sensitive.
	
* IF we are using '+' with number then it will perfrorm addition. and if '+' is used with the string then it will concatinate the string.
	
3. Operators:
	Used to perfomrs operations on operands or variavbles or values.
	
	1. Arthmatic
	2. Comparision
	3. Logical
	4. Assignment
	5. Condtional
	6. Bitwise.
	
	
	1. Arthmatic Operators:
		Addition
		Substraction
		multiplication
		Division
		Modulus
		Increment
		Decrement
		
	
	2. Comparision:
		Equal to 
		not equal to 
		double equal to 
		triple equal to 
		less than
		greater than 
		less than or equal to 
		greater than or equal to.
		
		* in == only value will be compoared and in === value as well as data type of that operands will be compoared.	
		
	3. Logical :
		Logical and AND
		logical OR
		logical XOR
		logical NOT
	
	4. Assignment:
		simple assignment ==> =
		add and assignment ==> +=
		sub and assignment ==> -=
		multiply and assignment ==> *=
		devide and assignment ==>/=
		modulus and assignment ==> %=
		
	5. Bitwise :
		Bitwise AND
		Bitwise OR
		Bitwise XOR
		
	6. Misc:
		TypeOf
		Ternory operator
