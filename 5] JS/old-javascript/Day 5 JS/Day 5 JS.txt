		Limitintations of cookies:
		Less secure 
		maximum limit 4kb.
		per website 20 cookies can be stored.
		allow plain data only
		any one can disable the cookies
		
	2. Local storage: 
		more secure 
		can store maximum data.
		no limitations per website.
		simplar way to store the data i.e. sytax is very simple.
		
		
		localStorage.setItem('key', 'value')
		localStorage.getItem('key')
		localStorage.removeItem('key')
		localStorage.clear() // it will clear all the data from localStorage.
		
	3. Session Storage:
