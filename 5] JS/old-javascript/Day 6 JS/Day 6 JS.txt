Navigation from one screen to another screen in JS:

If I want to navigate from one page to another depending on the business logic then I can navigate with the help of window.location.
window.location ="url";



Dialog Boxes:
1. Alert
2. Confirm
3. Prompt


Alert:
Only one option i.e. Ok button.
User doesn't have any other option.
So it is usedd to show warning message.
alert('Are u sure u can to continue')

Confirm:
Will have two options.
Depending on the situation or business logic user can click on Ok or cancel then further action can be taken.
confirm('Are u sure u can to continue');

Prompt:
In the prompt we can take the input from user.
depending on user's input we can write our business logic.
prompt('Please enter your age');


Data Types :
With the help of data types I can represnt data in differenct manner and I can impliment my business logic.

1. Number
2. Boolean
3. Null
4. Undefined
5. String
6. Object

Primitive Data types : 
	values will be stored directly in the memory.
	Number, string, Boolean, Null, Undefined

Non Primitive Data types :
	values will be stored with the help of reference/ address.
	Object


1. Number:
	var a = 15; 
	var b= 15.5;
	var c = 5+5;
	We can have integer, float inside the number data types.
	we can perform operations like typeOf, tostring, valueof on the number.
	can handle the opration on numbers.: +-*/%
	
	Number Methods: typeOf, tostring, valueof, NaN
	
2. Boolean:
	There will be two values i.e. true or false.
	false: 0
	true: 1
	
	Methods: typeOf, tostring, valueof.

3. Undefined and Null :
	Undefined means varaible is declared but value has not been assigned to that varaible. data type of undefined is undefined.
	
	Null is itself a value. data type of null is object.
